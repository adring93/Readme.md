# Semester Project 1 - Web Development

This is my project for the Semester Project 1 course at Noroff. The goal of this project is to manage and plan the development process of a web application using GitHub Projects. This README explains the project setup, my process, and how I approached the task.

## Project Overview

In this project, I was tasked with creating a detailed project plan for a web application. This includes defining tasks, assigning start and target dates, and tracking progress using GitHub Projects.

## Tools Used

- **GitHub Projects**: For task management, using the Kanban and Roadmap views.
- **GitHub Issues**: For tracking individual tasks and progress.
- **Markdown**: To document the process and reflection.

## Project Management Approach

### Task Breakdown
I have broken down the project into 15 discrete tasks, covering all key areas of the web application development process. Tasks are assigned dates, sizes, and priorities to ensure that I can track the progress and deliver the project on time.

### Kanban View
The Kanban board was used to organize tasks into different columns, which are:
- **Backlog**
- **Ready**
- **In Progress**
- **In Review**
- **Done**

Each task was moved across these columns as it progresses through its stages.

### Roadmap View
The Roadmap (Gantt chart) view is used to track the timeline of each task. Each task has a **Start Date** and **Target Date**. This view allows me to visualize the projectâ€™s progress over time.

### Reflection
Due to unforeseen challenges, such as illness and feeling overwhelmed, I had to adjust my timeline and task priorities. I completed the tasks to the best of my ability and documented my process thoroughly, including using GitHub Projects as a tool for managing and tracking my progress.

## Conclusion
This project helped me better understand the importance of project planning and time management in web development. I used GitHub Projects to manage my tasks, ensuring that the project progresses smoothly and that I can meet deadlines effectively.
